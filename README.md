Welcome to the goat stack.

## Where the fun begins 
- [React](https://react.dev/)
    - [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
    - [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)
    - [React-testing-library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/)
        - [Course taken](https://members.codewithmosh.com/courses/complete-react-testing-course/lectures/52312452)
    - [Zustand](https://docs.pmnd.rs/zustand/getting-started/introduction)
    - [Shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs)
        - [Theme Generator](https://themes.fkaya.dev/)
    -  [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation)
- [Supabase](https://supabase.com/)
- [posthog](https://posthog.com/pricing)
- PWA
    - [Caching](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/workbox/caching-strategies-overview)
    - [PWABuilder](https://www.pwabuilder.com/)
    - [Workbox](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/workbox/modules/workbox-sw)
        - Using their libraries, we can abstract away the route registration + the caching strategy



## Requirements 

[Shadcn requires for you to use their CLI to install components](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation/vite).

`npx shadcn-ui@latest add button`

Add the PWABuilder Studio extension from VSCode. You will need it to verify your PWA configuration.
